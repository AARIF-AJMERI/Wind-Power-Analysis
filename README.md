Wind Power Analysis – Project Report
1. Overview

This Excel dashboard provides a performance analysis of wind turbines using weekly operational data.
The report focuses on wind speed, power output, downtime, and turbine efficiency to understand overall energy generation patterns.

2. Key Metrics (KPIs)

The dashboard highlights the following KPIs:

Average Wind Speed: 9.3185 m/s

Total Energy Output: 4171.23 kWh

Turbine Efficiency: 8.34%

Total Downtime: 97.5 hours

Capacity Factor: 0.0463

These indicators help evaluate operational efficiency and weather conditions affecting performance.

3. Visual Analysis
A. Energy Trend Over Days

A bar chart shows daily power output from Sunday to Saturday.

The output fluctuates between 296 kWh and 732 kWh.

Highest output was recorded mid-week (Thursday & Friday).

B. Turbine-wise Energy Output

A column chart compares energy produced by each turbine (WT1, WT2, WT3).

WT2 and WT3 performed significantly better than WT1.

C. Maintenance vs Running Status

A pie chart displays the proportion of turbine operating time:

Most hours fall under Running state.

A smaller share reflects Maintenance downtime.

D. Wind Speed vs Power Output

A combined chart compares wind speed and energy output for each turbine:

WT2 and WT3 show higher wind speeds and correspondingly higher power output.

Shows positive correlation: higher wind speed → higher power generation.

4. Insights

Turbines WT2 and WT3 show stronger performance due to higher wind speeds.

Energy output is inconsistent across days, influenced by varying wind conditions.

Total downtime, although moderate, still impacts overall efficiency.

Capacity factor is low, indicating significant scope to improve turbine utilization.

5. Recommendations

Reduce downtime through scheduled preventive maintenance.

Monitor turbines during peak wind days to maximize output.

Investigate WT1 performance issues to improve efficiency.

Consider integrating Power BI or automated alerts for real-time monitoring.
